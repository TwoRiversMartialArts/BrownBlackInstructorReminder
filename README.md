# Reminder notification app for TRMA instructors

This will be scheduled to run on Mondays, Wednesdays
and Saturdays.  It will send a reminder to third dan
black belts and above regarding the need for an 
instructor to cover an upcoming brown belt / black belt
class.

- On Monday, the reminder is only sent if there is no
volunteer signed up for the upcoming Friday
- On Wednesday, the reminder is only sent if there
is no volunteer for either Friday or Sunday.
- On Saturday, the reminder is only sent if there
is no volunteer for that Sunday.

So if volunteers sign up ahead of time, no reminders
will be sent.

The sign-up is handled by a google calendar which
can be seen [here](http://friday.trma.us)

To request assistance, or be removed from the reminder
list, simply respond to one of the reminder emails.
No need to "reply all".

Pil sung.
